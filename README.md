Tumor Treatment Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes the effects of different treatments on tumor growth. The goal is to evaluate how well each treatment works by analyzing and visualizing tumor volume data.

Files
Mouse_metadata.csv: Contains information about the mice used in the study.
Study_results.csv: Contains tumor volume measurements and treatment results.
pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the script for data analysis and visualization.
README.md: This file.

Project Goals
Data Cleaning: Prepare the dataset for analysis by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
Statistical Analysis: Calculate summary statistics, such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation, for tumor volumes under different treatments.
Visualization: Generate plots to visualize trends, relationships, and potential outliers in the data.



Key Insights
Summary Statistics: Displays average values and variability of tumor volumes for each treatment regimen.
Final Tumor Volume: Shows the last recorded tumor volume for each mouse under different treatments.
Visualizations: Includes plots to illustrate how tumor volume changes over time and its relationship with mouse weight.
